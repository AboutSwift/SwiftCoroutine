/// A protocol that defines how to execute a task.
///
/// This protocol has extension methods that allow to launch coroutines on a current scheduler.
/// Inside the coroutine you can use such methods as `Coroutine.await(_:)`, `CoFuture.await()`,
/// and `CoroutineScheduler.await(_:)` to suspend the coroutine without blocking a thread
/// and resume it when the result is ready.
///
/// The framework includes the implementation of this protocol for `DispatchQueue`
/// and you can easily make the same for other schedulers as well.
/// ```
