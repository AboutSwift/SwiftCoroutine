Many languages, such as Kotlin, JavaScript, Go, Rust, C++, and others, already have [coroutines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroutine) support that makes the use of asynchronous code easier. 
This feature is not yet supported in Swift, but this can be improved by a framework without the need to change the language.

This is the first implementation of [coroutines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroutine) for Swift with iOS, macOS and Linux support. They make the [async/await](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Async/await) pattern implementation possible. In addition, the framework includes [futures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_and_promises) and channels for more flexibility and ease of use. All this allows to do things that were not possible in Swift before.

### Motivation

Asynchronous programming is usually associated with callbacks. It is quite convenient until there are too many of them and they start nesting. Then it's called a **pyramid of doom** or even **callback hell**.

Another problem of asynchronous programming is **error handling**, because Swift's natural error handling mechanism cannot be used.

Here is an expressly ugly example to show these problems.

```swift
asyncFetchImageURL(with: id) { (result: Result<URL, Error>) in
    switch result {
    case .success(let imageURL):
        URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: imageURL) { data, _, error in
            if let error = error {
                . . . error handling . . .
                return
            }
            guard let image = data.flatMap(UIImage.init) else {
                . . . error handling . . .
                return
            }
            DispatchQueue.global().async {
                do {
                    let thumbnail = try image.makeThumbnail() //some heavy task that throws
                    DispatchQueue.main.async {
                        self.imageView.image = thumbnail
                    }
                } catch {
                    . . . error handling . . .
                }
            }
        }.resume()
    case .failure(let error):
        . . . error handling . . .
    }
}
```

### Async/await solution

The [async/await](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Async/await) pattern is an alternative that allows an asynchronous, non-blocking function to be structured in a way similar to an ordinary synchronous function. 

It is already well-established in other programming languages and is an evolution in asynchronous programming. The implementation of this pattern is possible thanks to coroutines.

Letâ€™s have a look at the example with coroutines.


```swift
//executes coroutine on the main thread and returns CoFuture<Void> that we will use for error handling
DispatchQueue.main.coroutineFuture {
    
    //await CoFuture<URL> result that suspends coroutine and doesn't block the thread
    let url: URL = try asyncFetchImageURL(with: id).await()
    
    //await CoFuture<(data: Data, response: URLResponse)> result without blocking the thread
    let data: Data = try URLSession.shared.dataTaskFuture(for: url).await().data

    //create UIImage from data or throw the error
    guard let image = UIImage(data: data) else { throw URLError(.cannotParseResponse) }
    
    //execute heavy task on global queue and await the result without blocking the thread
    let thumbnail: UIImage = try DispatchQueue.global().await { try image.makeThumbnail() }

    //set image in UIImageView on the main thread
    self.imageView.image = thumbnail
    
}.whenFailure { error in

    . . . error handling . . . 
}
```

## Working with SwiftCoroutine

### Coroutines

A [coroutines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroutine) is a computation that can be suspended and resumed at a later time without blocking a thread. Coroutines build upon regular functions and makes them more flexible.

Coroutines can be executed on any scheduler and switched between schedulers during execution.

#### Key benefits

- **Suspend instead of block**. The main advantage of coroutines is the ability to suspend their execution at some point without blocking a thread and resuming later on.
- **Fast context switching**. Switching between coroutines is much faster than switching between threads as it does not require the involvement of operating system.
- **Asynchronous code in synchronous manner**. The use of coroutines allows an asynchronous, non-blocking function to be structured in a manner similar to an ordinary synchronous function. And even though coroutines can run in multiple threads, your code will still look consistent and therefore easy to understand.

#### Usage

The coroutines API design is as minimalistic as possible. It consists of the `CoroutineScheduler` protocol that describes how to schedule coroutines (`DispatchQueue` already conforms it), and the `Coroutine` structure with utility methods. This API is enough to do amazing things.

The following example shows the usage of  `await()` inside a coroutine to wrap asynchronous calls.

```swift
//execute coroutine on the main thread
DispatchQueue.main.startCoroutine {
    
    //await URLSessionDataTask response without blocking the thread
    let (data, response, error) = Coroutine.await {
        URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: url, completionHandler: $0).resume()
    }
    
    . . . use response on the main thread . . . 
}
```

Here's how we can conform `NSManagedObjectContext` to `CoroutineScheduler` for launching coroutines on it.

```swift
extension NSManagedObjectContext: CoroutineScheduler {

    func scheduleTask(_ task: @escaping () -> Void) {
        perform(task)
    }
    
}

//execute coroutine on the main thread
DispatchQueue.main.startCoroutine {
    let context: NSManagedObjectContext //context with privateQueueConcurrencyType
    let request: NSFetchRequest<Entity> //some complex request

    //execute request on the context without blocking the main thread
    let result = try context.await { try context.fetch(request) }
}
```

### Futures and Promises

A future is a read-only holder for a result that will be provided later and the promise is the provider of this result. They represent the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation.

The [futures and promises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_and_promises) approach itself has become an industry standart. It is a convenient mechanism to synchronize asynchronous code. But together with coroutines, it takes the usage of asynchronous code to the next level and has become a part of the async/await pattern. If coroutines are a skeleton, then futures and promises are its muscles.

#### Main features

- **Performance**. It is much faster than most of other futures and promises implementations.
- **Awaitable**. You can await the result inside the coroutine.
- **Cancellable**. You can cancel the whole chain as well as handle it and complete the related actions.

#### Usage

Futures and promises are represented by the corresponding `CoFuture` class and its `CoPromise` subclass. 

```swift
//wraps some async func with CoFuture
func makeIntFuture() -> CoFuture<Int> {
    let promise = CoPromise<Int>()
    someAsyncFunc { int in
        promise.success(int)
    }
    return promise
}
```

It allows to start multiple tasks in parallel and synchronize them later with `await()`.

```swift
//create CoFuture<Int> that takes 2 sec. from the example above 
let future1 = makeIntFuture()

//execute task on the global queue and returns CoFuture<Int> with future result
let future2: CoFuture<Int> = DispatchQueue.global().coroutineFuture {
    Coroutine.delay(.seconds(3)) //some work that takes 3 sec.
    return 6
}

//execute coroutine on the main thread
DispatchQueue.main.startCoroutine {
    let sum = try future1.await() + future2.await() //will await for 3 sec.
    self.label.text = "Sum is \(sum)"
}
```

It's very easy to transform or compose `CoFuture`s into a new one.

```swift
let array: [CoFuture<Int>]

//create new CoFuture<Int> with sum of future results
let sum = CoFuture { try array.reduce(0) { try $0 + $1.await() } }
```

Apple has introduced a new reactive programming framework `Combine` that makes writing asynchronous code easier and includes a lot of convenient and common functionality. We can use it with coroutines by making `CoFuture` a subscriber and await its result.

```swift
//create Combine publisher
let publisher = URLSession.shared.dataTaskPublisher(for: url).map(\.data)

//execute coroutine on the main thread
DispatchQueue.main.startCoroutine {
    //subscribe CoFuture to publisher
    let future = publisher.subscribeCoFuture()
    
    //await data without blocking the thread
    let data = try future.await()
}
```

### Channels

Futures and promises provide a convenient way to transfer a single value between coroutines. Channels provide a way to transfer a stream of values. Conceptually, a channel is similar to a queue that allows to suspend a coroutine on receive if it is empty, or on send if it is full.

This non-blocking primitive is widely used in such languages as Go and Kotlin, and it is another instrument that improves working with coroutines.

#### Usage

To create channels, use the `CoChannel` class.

```swift
//create a channel with a buffer which can store only one element
let channel = CoChannel<Int>(maxBufferSize: 1)

DispatchQueue.global().startCoroutine {
    for i in 0..<10 {
        //imitate some work
        Coroutine.delay(.seconds(1))
        //sends a value to the channel and suspends coroutine if its buffer is full
        try channel.awaitSend(i)
    }
    
    //close channel when all values are sent
    channel.close()
}

DispatchQueue.global().startCoroutine {
    //receives values until closed and suspends a coroutine if it's empty
    for i in channel {
        print("Receive", i)
    }
    
    print("Done")
}
```
